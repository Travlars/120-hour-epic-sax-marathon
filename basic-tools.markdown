% Basic Tools

## First things first

To successfully work through this course, you need to do the following
things:

- install Java
- install a sane editor: Light Table, Vim or Emacs
- install Git
- install Leiningen
- make sure to have a github account
- read the submission instructions very carefully 

## Java

Clojure runs on JVM, so you need to have the Java JDK installed. On
Linux this is easily done using the distribution package manager.

On Windows you need to download the latest JDK from Oracle's site and
install it. You also need to add the JDK bin directory to the Path.
Right click Computer, select Properties, select Advanced system
settings, select Environment Variables and Edit the Path to contain
the `bin` directory of the JDK installation usually found under
`Program Files`. Don't hesitate to ask if you encounter any problems.


## Your very own butler

[Leiningen] is a project management tool for Clojure projects. It
handles various tasks related to projects, including building the
project, declaring and fetching dependencies, opening an interactive
session inside the project, and other such things.

Here's the instructions for installing Leiningen in Linux:

1. In your home directory, create a directory called `bin` if it does
   not exist all ready.

    ~~~ {.sh}
    cd ~
    mkdir bin
    ~~~

2. Add this directory to your $PATH. If you are using Bash, put the
   following inside the file `~/.bashrc`. If you are using some other
   shell, do this where you would normally do these kind of things. If
   you don't know what shell you are using, you are using Bash.

    ~~~ {.sh}
    export PATH=$PATH:~/bin
    ~~~

3. Source the `~/.bashrc` file to apply the changes.

    ~~~ {.sh}
    source ~/.bashrc
    ~~~

3. Download [this][LeinInstall] script. Put it in the `~/bin`
   directory created in step 1.

4. Make the script you just downloaded executable.

    ~~~ {.sh}
    chmod +x ~/bin/lein
    ~~~

5. In any directory, issue the command `lein help`. This will first
   download the rest of Leiningen. After the download is complete you
   get a list of services provided by Leiningen.

For Windows there is an
[installer](http://leiningen-win-installer.djpowell.net/) that does
all this for you. You only need to have Java installed.

The table below contains some important Leiningen commands.

Command         Description
-------         -----------
midje           Run all [Midje] tests.
repl            Open an interactive Clojure session.
new             Create a new Clojure project.

To get more information about a command, run `lein help <command>`.

The heart of every Leiningen project is the file `project.clj` at the
top level of the projects directory tree. It contains information
about the projects name, version and dependecies among other things.

## Git

[Git][Git] is a distributed version control system, which is a fancy name for
a tool that keeps track of changes made to files under a directory
tree. We use this tool to distribute pre-made Leiningen projects in
which you can complete the exercises of every chapter. You also use
Git to submit your answers. If you have any problems with Git, ask.

To install Git on Linux, use your distribution package manager. In
Windows, point your browser to [http://git-scm.com/][Git], where you
can find both the binaries and comprehensive documentation. On
Windows it's easiest to use the Git-bash that comes with Git.

There are three basic commands that you need to know to successfully
submit exercises:

- `git clone` will clone you a local copy of a repository
- `git commit -a -m "message goes here"` will add your changes into the git
  repository. The message should summarise what has changed.
- `git push` will upload the changes previously commited to github

## How to submit answers to exercises

At the start of every chapter, you should go to [Github][Github] and *fork* the
chapters repository. There will be a link to the appropriate repository at the
beginning of every chapter. You then *clone* your **own** fork of the
repository and start working with the exercises when you encounter them among
the material. You create *commits* and maybe *push* them in to your own fork
while working. You also run the tests with `lein midje` to see if they pass.

When you want your answers graded, you push all of your work with `git push`.
You then go to Github and send a *pull request*. At this point,
[Travis][Travis] kicks in. It runs the tests for your code and then comments on
the pull request whether the tests passed or failed. A link is also provided to
see the nitty-gritty details.

If you didn't get all the tests to pass on the first go, don't worry, you can
try again. Just make modifications to the code, create a commit, and push. The
pull request will be updated, Travis will rerun the tests and a new comment
about the build status will be posted. You can keep trying as many times as you
want.

### Be prepared

Let's go through the first part of this process to be ready for the next
chapter.

1. Go to the Github page of the repository of the next chapter. Here is the
   [link](https://github.com/iloveponies/training-day).

2. Click the Fork-button near the top-right corner of the page. You will be
   asked to login if you haven't done so already.

3. The Github page of your fork will open. This is the repository you want to
   clone. Click the button that says HTTP and copy the link from the box. Then
   issue the following command with **your** version of the link. Your Github
   login information will be requested.

    ~~~ {.sh}
    git clone https://github.com/<my-account>/training-day.git
    ~~~

4. A directory called `training-day` will be created. Go inside the directory and
   issue `lein midje`. You should see output that tells you that every test in
   the project has failed.

    ~~~ {.sh}
    cd training-day
    lein midje
    ~~~
   Instead of `lein midje`, you can issue the command

    ~~~ {.sh}
    lein midje :autotest
    ~~~
   This starts a loop which runs the tests again every time you make
   changes to any of the projects files. A very handy feature, as
   running plain `lein midje` has a pretty long startup time.

5. You are now ready to start working with the exercises. Whenever you
   encounter an exercise in the material, open the file `src/training_day.clj`
   and fill the appropriate function. Run `lein midje` often to see if the
   tests pass.

## Editor

As a lisp, Clojure requires some support from the text editor to be pleasant to
write. Luckily a guy named Chris Granger has started a project to create an
editor called Light Table. It's still quite beta (you might encounter some
bugs), but works nicely for your purposes during this course.  [Check it
out][LightTable]. When in doubt, use this.

Light Table is more or less like an ordinary editor with some IDE like
features. The thing that sets Light Table apart is the Instarepl. It
is a tool in which you can write Clojure code, run it and instantly
see the results. This is a great environment to test ideas and also to
solve the exercises. Many think that working in the repl is one of the
best things in Clojure developement.

When you open Light Table, you want to open your project.

1. Open `View -> Workspace`
2. Click `folder`
3. Open the directory of the project that you just cloned with Git
4. Open `View -> Commands` (shortcut Ctrl+Space)
5. Search for `connect` and select `Connect: Add Connection`
6. Select Clojure
7. Select the `project.clj` file in the directory of the cloned project

Optionally, if you have a larger monitor, you can split Light Table into two
columns:

1. Open the command bar
2. Search for tabset
3. Click `Tabset: Add a tabset`

You can now move tabs between these tabsets by dragging them from one to
another.

Finally, to start using Light Tables awesome instarepl, do the following:

1. Using the command bar, search for instarepl
2. Select `Instarepl: Open a clojure instarepl`
3. Light Table might ask you which connection you want the instarepl to use.
   Select the project you connected earlier to (`training-day 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT`)

Now that you have an instarepl open, you can write some clojure on it, like `(+
2 3)`. Finally, to use this instarepl to test your implementations in the
exercise file, you need to `use` the namespace. To do this, write

~~~{.clj}
(use 'training-day)
~~~

in the beginning of the instarepl window. Now you can, for example, evaluate

~~~{.clj}
(square 7)
~~~

below the `use` row and in general use anything defined in the namespace you
just used. For more information about Light Table, see the shortish
[docs][LightTableDocs] page.

Not suprisingly, both Vim and Emacs have good plug-ins to work with Clojure.
For the basics, one should install the clojure-mode from the Emacs package
manager. For a more complete set of tools we can recommend [Emacs Starter
Kit][EST]. In Vim, [VimClojure][VimClojure] provides you with the necessary
goodies. There is also a [Clojure indentation plugin][SublimeIndent] for
[Sublime Text][Sublime] if that is your poison of choice.
